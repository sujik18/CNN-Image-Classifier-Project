# CNN-Image-Classifier-Project
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project to identify the class of input image. In this project the input images are divided into one of two classes which are Dogs and Cats, and the model is trained and tested over 300 unique images.

The dataset is divided into two folders, one for each class. The dataset is further divided into training and testing data. The training data is used to train the model and the testing data is used to test the model.

The model is trained using the training data and then tested using the testing data. The model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the accuracy of the model is calculated using the testing data.

The model is trained using the following layers:
1. Convolutional Layer
2. Max Pooling Layer
3. Flatten Layer
4. Dense Layer
5. Output Layer

The model is trained using the following parameters:
1. Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy
2. Optimizer: Adam
3. Metrics: Accuracy

The model is trained using the following hyperparameters:
